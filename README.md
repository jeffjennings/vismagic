Simple tools for interfacing with, visualizing and assessing visibility datasets, as well as manipulating and performing basic analysis on images, for use in sub-mm astronomy. Functionalities are in standalone modules, including:
- `uv_to_ms.py`: Convert a visibility dataset (`.npz` or ASCII format) to a measurement set for use in the CASA custom Python environment.
